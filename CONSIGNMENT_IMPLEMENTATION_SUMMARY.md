# Consignment Commission Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of consignment product functionality with automatic commission calculation in the FastAPI Bengkel system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Product Table - New Columns Added:
- `supplier_id` (UUID, nullable) - References supplier table
- `is_consignment` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE) - Flags if product is consignment
- `consignment_commission` (NUMERIC(10,2), nullable) - Commission rate per unit

#### Migration Files:
- **database_baru/product_consignment_add.sql** - Migration script for existing databases
- **database_baru/product_postgres.sql** - Updated base schema for fresh installations

### 2. Model Updates

#### models/workorder.py - Product Model:
```python
class Product(Base):
    # ... existing fields ...
    supplier_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey('supplier.id'), nullable=True)
    is_consignment = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
    consignment_commission = Column(Numeric(10,2), nullable=True)
    
    supplier = relationship('Supplier', back_populates='products')
```

### 3. Schema Updates

#### schemas/service_product.py:

**CreateProduct Schema:**
- Added `supplier_id: Optional[UUID]`
- Added `is_consignment: bool = False`
- Added `consignment_commission: Optional[Decimal]`

**ProductResponse Schema:**
- Added same fields as CreateProduct for complete data representation

### 4. Service Layer Updates

#### services/services_product.py:

**CreateProductNew Function:**
- Now handles `supplier_id`, `is_consignment`, and `consignment_commission` fields
- Properly saves consignment data to database

**Product Retrieval Functions:**
- `get_all_products()` - Now includes `supplier_name` in response
- `get_product_by_id()` - Now includes `supplier_name` in response
- `getAllInventoryProducts()` - Now includes `supplier_name` in response
- `getInventoryByProductID()` - Now includes `supplier_name` in response

### 5. Accounting Integration

#### services/services_accounting.py:

**create_sales_journal_entry Function:**
Enhanced to automatically calculate and record consignment commission:

```python
# When a workorder is completed with consignment products:
# 1. Calculate total commission: quantity × commission_rate
# 2. Record journal entries:
#    Dr 6003 (Beban Komisi Konsinyasi)     commission_amount
#       Cr 3002 (Hutang Komisi Konsinyasi) commission_amount
```

**Journal Entry Logic:**
- Automatically detects consignment products in workorder
- Calculates commission for each consignment product
- Records commission as expense (Dr) and payable to supplier (Cr)
- Account codes used:
  - **6003**: Beban Komisi Konsinyasi (Commission Expense)
  - **3002**: Hutang Komisi Konsinyasi (Commission Payable)

## How It Works

### Product Creation Flow:
1. User creates product with consignment fields
2. System validates and saves product data
3. Supplier relationship is established if supplier_id provided

### Sales Flow with Consignment:
1. Workorder is created with products (some may be consignment)
2. When workorder status changes to 'selesai' (completed):
   - Sales journal entry is created
   - System checks each product in workorder
   - For consignment products:
     - Calculates: `commission = quantity × consignment_commission`
     - Records commission expense and payable
3. Commission payable remains in books until paid to supplier

### Accounting Impact:
```
Example: Sell 5 units of consignment product with Rp 10,000 commission/unit

Journal Entry:
Dr Beban Komisi Konsinyasi (6003)      Rp 50,000
   Cr Hutang Komisi Konsinyasi (3002)  Rp 50,000
```

## Database Migration

### For Existing Databases:
Run the migration script:
```sql
psql -U username -d database_name -f database_baru/product_consignment_add.sql
```

### For New Installations:
The base schema (product_postgres.sql) already includes all consignment fields.

## API Usage Examples

### Create Consignment Product:
```json
POST /products/create/new
{
  "name": "Product Konsinyasi A",
  "type": "spare_part",
  "description": "Produk titipan dari supplier",
  "price": 150000,
  "cost": 100000,
  "min_stock": 10,
  "brand_id": "uuid-here",
  "satuan_id": "uuid-here",
  "category_id": "uuid-here",
  "supplier_id": "uuid-supplier",
  "is_consignment": true,
  "consignment_commission": 15000
}
```

### Response Includes:
```json
{
  "id": "product-uuid",
  "name": "Product Konsinyasi A",
  "is_consignment": true,
  "consignment_commission": 15000,
  "supplier_id": "uuid-supplier",
  "supplier_name": "Nama Supplier",
  ...
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create consignment product with commission
- [ ] Create regular product (non-consignment)
- [ ] Create workorder with consignment products
- [ ] Complete workorder and verify journal entries
- [ ] Check commission expense recorded correctly
- [ ] Check commission payable recorded correctly
- [ ] Verify supplier information displayed in product lists
- [ ] Test product retrieval endpoints
- [ ] Test inventory endpoints with consignment products

## Account Codes Reference

| Code | Account Name | Type | Usage |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| 6003 | Beban Komisi Konsinyasi | Expense | Commission expense when consignment sold |
| 3002 | Hutang Komisi Konsinyasi | Liability | Payable to supplier for commission |

**Note:** Ensure these accounts exist in your chart of accounts before using consignment features.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Commission Payment Tracking:**
   - Add functionality to record commission payments to suppliers
   - Track outstanding commission payables per supplier

2. **Consignment Reports:**
   - Report showing all consignment products
   - Commission summary by supplier
   - Outstanding commission payables report

3. **Supplier Portal:**
   - Allow suppliers to view their consignment products
   - Show commission earnings
   - Track payment history

4. **Automated Alerts:**
   - Notify when consignment stock is low
   - Alert for pending commission payments

## Files Modified

1. `models/workorder.py` - Product model (already updated)
2. `schemas/service_product.py` - Product schemas
3. `services/services_product.py` - Product service functions
4. `services/services_accounting.py` - Accounting journal entries
5. `database_baru/product_postgres.sql` - Base schema
6. `database_baru/product_consignment_add.sql` - Migration script (new)

## Notes

- Commission is calculated per unit sold
- Commission is recorded as expense when sale is completed
- Supplier relationship is optional (can be null)
- Non-consignment products work exactly as before
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
