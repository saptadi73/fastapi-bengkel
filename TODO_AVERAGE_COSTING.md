# Average Costing Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Database Changes
- [x] Created `database_baru/product_cost_history_postgres.sql` - SQL migration file for new table

### 2. Model Changes
- [x] Added `ProductCostHistory` model to `models/inventory.py`

### 3. Schema Changes
- [x] Added `ProductCostHistoryResponse` schema to `schemas/service_product.py`
- [x] Added `ProductCostHistoryRequest` schema to `schemas/service_product.py`

### 4. Service Layer
- [x] Created `services/services_costing.py` with functions:
  - `calculate_average_cost()` - Calculate average cost for purchases
  - `calculate_average_cost_for_adjustment()` - Track cost for adjustments
  - `get_product_cost_history()` - Get cost history with filters
  - `get_product_cost_summary()` - Get cost summary for a product

- [x] Updated `services/services_purchase_order.py`:
  - Integrated `calculate_average_cost()` in `edit_purchase_order()` when status changes to 'diterima'

- [x] Updated `services/services_inventory.py`:
  - Integrated `calculate_average_cost_for_adjustment()` in `manual_adjustment_inventory()`

## Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 5. Routes Layer
- [ ] Add cost history endpoints to `routes/routes_product.py`:
  - `GET /products/{product_id}/cost-history` - Get cost history for specific product
  - `GET /products/cost-history` - Get all cost history with filters
  - `GET /products/{product_id}/cost-summary` - Get cost summary for product

### 6. Database Migration
- [ ] Run SQL migration to create `product_cost_history` table
- [ ] Verify table creation in PostgreSQL

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Test average costing with Purchase Order:
  - Create PO with status 'draft'
  - Change status to 'diterima'
  - Verify cost calculation and history
- [ ] Test with existing stock scenario
- [ ] Test with zero stock scenario
- [ ] Test with consignment products (should skip)
- [ ] Test manual inventory adjustment
- [ ] Test cost history API endpoints

## Implementation Notes

### Average Cost Formula
```
if current_quantity == 0:
    new_cost = purchase_price
else:
    new_cost = (current_qty Ã— current_cost + purchase_qty Ã— purchase_price) / (current_qty + purchase_qty)
```

### Key Features
- âœ… Automatic cost calculation when PO status changes to 'diterima'
- âœ… Cost tracking for manual inventory adjustments
- âœ… Skips calculation for consignment products (`is_consignment=True`)
- âœ… Complete cost history tracking
- âœ… Error handling to prevent system failures

### Files Modified
1. `database_baru/product_cost_history_postgres.sql` (NEW)
2. `models/inventory.py` (MODIFIED)
3. `schemas/service_product.py` (MODIFIED)
4. `services/services_costing.py` (NEW)
5. `services/services_purchase_order.py` (MODIFIED)
6. `services/services_inventory.py` (MODIFIED)

## Next Steps
